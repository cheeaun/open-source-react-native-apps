# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested apps should documented : A description is the bare minimum. Screenshots of the app in it's own readme is perfect.
- Don't mention React Native in the description as it's implied.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[AppName](link) - Description.`
- Link to the GitHub repo only.
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestion!
